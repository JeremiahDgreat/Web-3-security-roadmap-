## ✅ 30-Day Solidity Audit Reproduction Plan

### Week 1: Vulnerability Familiarization
- [ ] Day 1–2: Study 3 vulnerabilities from solodit
- [ ] Day 3–4: Analyze a past Code4rena contest (e.g. [Sablier](https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-10-sablier-v2-contest))
- [ ] Day 5–7: Reproduce a known bug in Foundry and document it

### Week 2: Focused Vulnerability Classes
- [ ] Day 8–9: Reentrancy & Access Control - try to reproduce DAO or ReentrancyGuard bugs
- [ ] Day 10–11: Oracle Manipulation - study [bZx hack](https://rekt.news/bzx-rekt/)
- [ ] Day 12–14: Run Slither on a recent project and review findings

### Week 3: Simulated Audit Experience
- [ ] Day 15–17: Choose and audit a recent contract (real or C4 repo)
- [ ] Day 18–20: Compare your findings with top submissions
- [ ] Day 21: Use Foundry/Echidna to fuzz test for issues

### Week 4: Pattern Mastery & Reporting
- [ ] Day 22–24: Build your own audit/vulnerability checklist
- [ ] Day 25–27: Read 3 professional audit reports (ToB, OZ, Sherlock)
- [ ] Day 28–30: Publish your learning in a blog, gist, or repo write-up

## ⚙️ Rust for Security Crash Roadmap (6 Weeks)

### Week 1: Rust Language Basics
- [ ] Complete [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- [ ] Skim [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (Ch. 4–6, 8, 10)

### Week 2: Smart Contract Frameworks
- [ ] Learn [Solana Security](https://book.anchor-lang.com/security.html) best practices
- [ ] Try Anchor Hello World
- [ ] Explore Ink! or CosmWasm samples

### Week 3–4: Memory and Unsafe Code Auditing
- [ ] Learn common Rust memory vulnerabilities
- [ ] Read and analyze an Anchor program for flaws
- [ ] Practice identifying panics, unwraps, and concurrency risks

### Week 5–6: Protocol-Level Analysis
- [ ] Read about Mango Markets or Wormhole exploits
- [ ] Analyze a real Solana/Sui core repo
- [ ] Document 1 exploit or issue you find or simulate
